            <br> 
           
            <p>Hi, I’m Mahia Chowdhury. I’m a passionate software developer based in Queens, New York City. I specialize in creating responsive, accessible websites and web applications using modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science at Williams College, with a focus on artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning. I am also the co-chair of the Computer Science Club, where I help organize events and initiatives that promote diversity in tech.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have hands-on experience with various coding projects, including coding a COVID-19 chatbot, a global chloropleth map of COVID-19 positivity rates, and a plot showing the correlation between Gender Inequality Index and a country's Gross Domestic Product.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore my skills and projects, or reach out if you’re interested in collaborating or learning more about my work.</p>
